            <h1>Why Use a Mortgage Calculator?</h1>
            <p role="complementary">When purchasing a new home, most buyers choose to finance a portion of the purchase price via the use of a mortgage. Prior to the wide availability of mortgage calculators, those wishing to understand the financial implications of changes
        to the five main variables in a mortgage transaction were forced to use compound interest rate tables. These tables generally required a working understanding of compound interest mathematics for proper use. In contrast, mortgage calculators make
        answers to questions regarding the impact of changes in mortgage variables available to everyone. Mortgage calculators can be used to answer such questions as: If one borrows $250,000 at a 7% annual interest rate and pays the loan back over thirty
        years, with $3,000 annual property tax payment, $1,500 annual property insurance cost and 0.5% annual private mortgage insurance payment, what will the monthly payment be? The answer is $2,142.42. A potential borrower can use an online mortgage
        calculator to see how much property he or she can afford. A lender will compare the person's total monthly income and total monthly debt load. A mortgage calculator can help to add up all income sources and compare this to all monthly debt payments.
        It can also factor in a potential mortgage payment and other associated housing costs (property taxes, homeownership dues, etc.). The typical mortgage calculator does not include costs like maintenance costs, refurbishment, landlord insurance,
        and other extra costs like service fees, property management costs, etc.[3] One can test different loan sizes and interest rates. Generally speaking, lenders do not like to see all of a borrower's debt payments (including property expenses) exceed
        around 40% of total monthly pretax income. Some mortgage lenders are known to allow as high as 55%.</p>
